## What I learned
This is my first major project. Through this project I learned about using APIs, writing asynchronous code, and navigating through documentations. I also got to develop other skills through this project: debugging, OOP, SQL, and Python.

## Acknowledgments
The 5-letter-words.txt file in this repository contains the majority of the words from Donald E. Knuth's compiled 5 letter word list (found [here](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html)) but the list has been modified to suit the needs of this project.
